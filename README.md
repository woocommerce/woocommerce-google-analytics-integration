WordPress plugin: Provides the integration between WooCommerce and Google Analytics.

Will be required for WooCommerce shops using the integration from WooCommerce 2.1 and up.

- [WordPress.org plugin page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/)
- [WooCommerce.com product page (free)](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-google-analytics/)
- [User documentation](https://woocommerce.com/document/google-analytics-integration/)

## NPM Scripts

Google Analytics for WooCommerce utilizes npm scripts for task management utilities.

`npm run build` - Runs the tasks necessary for a release. These may include building JavaScript, SASS, CSS minification, and language files.

The `engines` in package.json includes npm `^9` to allow dependabot to update our dependencies. However, it's not the version intended to be used in development.

-   See https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/9277

## Unit tests
### Running PHP unit tests in your local dev environment
1. Install prerequisites: composer, git, xdebug, svn, wget or curl, mysqladmin
2. `cd` into the `woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/` plugin directory
3. Run `composer install`
4. Run `bin/install-unit-tests.sh <db-name> <db-user> <db-pass> [db-host] [wp-version] [wc-version] [skip-database-creation]` e.g. `bin/install-unit-tests.sh wordpress_test root root localhost latest latest`
5. Run `XDEBUG_MODE=coverage vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text` to run all unit test

_For more info see: [WordPress.org > Plugin Unit Tests](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/misc/plugin-unit-tests/#running-tests-locally)._

## E2E Testing

E2E testing uses [wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) which requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Make sure Docker is running in your machine, and run the following:

`npm run wp-env:up` - This will automatically download and run WordPress in a Docker container. You can access it at http://localhost:8889 (Username: admin, Password: password).

To install the PlayWright browser locally you can run:
`npx playwright install chromium`

Run E2E testing:

-   `npm run test:e2e` to run the test in headless mode.
-   `npm run test:e2e-dev` to run the tests in Chromium browser.

To remove the Docker container and images (this will **delete everything** in the WordPress Docker container):

`npm run wp-env destroy`

:warning: Currently, the E2E testing on GitHub Actions is only run automatically after opening a PR with `release/*` branches or pushing changes to `release/*` branches. To run it manually, please visit [here](../../actions/workflows/e2e-tests.yml) and follow [this instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow?tool=webui) to do so.

## Coding standards checks

1. Run `composer install` (_if you haven't done so already_)
2. Run `npm run lint:php`

An explanation of output can be [found here](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Usage#printing-progress-information) e.g. what are the S's?

### Consent Mode

The extension sets up [the default state of consent mode](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/guides/consent?hl=en&consentmode=advanced#default-consent), denying all parameters for the EEA region. You can append or overwrite that configuration using the following snippet:

```php
add_filter( 'woocommerce_ga_gtag_consent_modes', function ( $consent_modes ) {
    $consent_modes[] =
		array(
            'analytics_storage' => 'granted',
            'region'            => array( 'ES' ),
        );
    $consent_modes[] =
        array(
            'analytics_storage' => 'denied',
            'region'            => array( 'US-AK' ),
        );
   return $consent_modes;
} );
```

After the page loads, the consent for particular parameters can be updated by other plugins or custom code, implementing UI for customer-facing configuration using [Google's consent API](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/guides/consent?hl=en&consentmode=advanced#update-consent) (`gtag('consent', 'update', {â€¦})`).

#### Cookie banners & WP Consent API

The extension does not provide any UI, like a cookie banner, to let your visitors grant consent for tracking. However, it's integrated with [WP Consent API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-consent-api/), so you can pick another extension that provides a banner that meets your needs.

Each of those extensions may require additional setup or registration. Usually, the basic default setup works out of the box, but there may be some integration caveats. Here are a couple of the most frequent ones:

##### GA4W overwrites the consent mode defaults set by the other extension

If the additional extension you chose sets its own default state of consent modes, different than the one we set, and you would like to make sure we'll not overwrite that, you can use the `woocommerce_ga_gtag_consent_modes` snippet to change or disable our setup:

```php
add_filter( 'woocommerce_ga_gtag_consent_modes', function ( $consent_modes ) {
   return array();
} );
```

##### I want to stop firing the `page_view` event on the page load

This is actually unrelated to the consent mode; it's a matter of the default tag config. You can alter it using the `woocommerce_ga_gtag_config` snippet

```php
add_filter( 'woocommerce_ga_gtag_config', function ( $config ) {
    $config['send_page_view'] = false;
   return $config;
} );
```
